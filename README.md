# ntfs-cpu-search
Quickly search for files in NTFS volumes parsing the Master File Table (MFT). This implementation searches for substrings only.

# Background
This is the CPU-only release. An ntfs-amd-search also existed with contained both CPU and GPU implementations. That release won an honorable mention in the AMD OpenCL Competition back in 2011 (see amd\readme.pdf).

# Vegnos Desktop Search
Vegnos supports glob and regular expression searches, as well as recovering files. This refined implementation is available here: http://www.vegnos.com/
